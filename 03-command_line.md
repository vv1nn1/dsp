### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > `xargs` reads items from the standard input, delimited by blanks or newlines, and executes the command (press ctrl-D). Blank lines on the standard input are ignored. Use `find` and `xargs` to search for files that contain a specific string. Ex: `$ find /Users -name "*.py" | xargs grep "by Winnie"`
